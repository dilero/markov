# markov-chain-library

**Markov chain** is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. 

**Markov chain libary** is implemented for the CRUD(create, read, update and delete) operation context. Library  generates feature from CRUD operations sequences data. It enriches the feature vector before classification.As a result, generated markov feature improves classification results.
