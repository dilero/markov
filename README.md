# markov-chain

Markov chain library to generate feature from CRUD operation sequence data. It enriches the feature vector before classification. Generated markov feature improves classification results.

A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
Markov chain libary is implemented for the CRUD(create, read, update and delete) operation context.
